            As in most coding languages, the most basic program you can write is the "Hello World" program. This is a simple program that prints the words "Hello World" to the screen. In LUA, this is done with the following code:
            <div class = "box">
                <pre>
                    <code class = "lanuage-lua line-numbers">
                        print("Hello World")
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </p>
    </body>
